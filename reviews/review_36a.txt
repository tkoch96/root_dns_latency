Paper summary
-------------
Anycast is used to support different services. Two examples are DNS and CDN. The authors compare sensitivity to delay for the two services. They state that sub-optimal delay performance for the the root DNS may not be important because the root DNS is not queried that often. Content is often cached and users will only perceive 10-15 ms delay increase over a whole day. They compare this to the delay to retrieve web content. Page load time takes a few RTTs (10 in average, they say) and content is larger. In that case sub-optimal delay is more critical. The second aspect studied is the path inflation. That is, how much delay is lost reaching the anycast site compared to the best geographical delay (for DNS and CDN) or for the CDN compared to the closest front end latency. They show that more sites lead to more path inflation for both the DNS and the CDN. But they say that for the CDN the inflation is not big compared to the base line delay to access the content. It only increases delay by a small portion because CDNs are well engineered toward delay minimization. They state that DNS roots deployments are not optimized toward delay as there is little incentive to do this since it has little impact on users.

Technical correctness
---------------------
4. Good

Strengths
---------
- provides an alternative view on the importance of delay for root DNS.
- compares the difference in requirements between CDNs and DNS root.

Things to improve
-----------------
- description of the rings is not clear. What is the role of each ring? How are users dispatched to different rings? They all seem to cover the globe. Are different rings really good representatives of different scales of deployments?
- the distinction between unicast and anycast path inflation that is made is confusing. Please emphasize on why it is enough to look at anycast path inflation? Is unicast path inflation included in anycast path inflation?
- you have the catchment for most of the DNS root letters so why do you not study the effect of routing on the inflation for the DNS. This is done for the CDN but not for the DNS. Previous studies were investigation that aspect of inflation. If you do not consider it you cannot really say that there is no improvements to be done regarding that aspect for the DNS because you do not know how bad it is.
- fig 4a picturing relative delays does not help understanding. If RIPE Atlas can be used to measure the performance of the CDN, why is the absolute CDF of delay proprietary? You could at least provide the interquartile range of RTTs to give a clearer picture of the behavior. It would be useful to compare the distributions that can be observed with RIPE Atlas probes to the ones obtained from the CDN user base (even if limited to the interquartile portion of the distribution)

Comments for author
-------------------
- 1. of the its role -> remove "the"
- 2.3 The estimation of the number of times the root DNS needs to be queries per user depends on the cache sizes in - recursive resolvers. Are caches large enough such that information is never removed before the TTL expires?
- Fig 1. is not very instructive in that some deployments do not seem to appear on the figure, or there is a color mismatch between the map and the legend. For example, where is R110? I further do not see the information about the size of the user base on the figure.
- What are the RIPE Atlas measurement ids used for this study?
- 4.1 quieres -> queries
- Legend of fig 3 is too small
- 4.2 Latenticies per page load are obtained from the median RTT times by median number of RTT. Does this not hide a lot of useful information regarding performance? Please provide some information on the distribution of RTTs. Regarding the median number of RTTs you use 10 but this seems small in view of fig 13. in the appendix.
- 4.2 you use user/resolver location for some of the study. Which information do you use? Why then not apply eq 3 for the DNS as well.
- Fig 5 b does not add much new insight.
- 5.1
-- It will help to add more explanation to why you set unicast path inflation to 0. How do you compare to the best unicast path to measure inflation?
-- Figure 6, top x axis. Isn't the unit in seconds?
-- 0.4% of geolocated DITL query is very little. You are talking about the ability to locate recursive? Is the study representative then?
-- You do not take routing into consideration, nor the experienced/measured RTT. This is very different from past studies. Can you still make statements about past studies not being pertinent?
-- A study of unicast and anycast path inflation would be useful to grasp the difference in your two settings (DNS and CDN).
-- in the perspective in two ways -> remove "the"
-- Do you measure inflation from any RIPE Atlas to any x in x-root?
- 5.2
-- eq 3, you remove everything below 0. Isn't it where the interesting information lies?
